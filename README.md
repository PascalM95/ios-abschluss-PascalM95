# Wattblock

This is my graduation Project at Syntax Institute.
It's about the bavarian card game "Watten".
You can write the points of every single round of the game.
You can add and delete players.
You can register with email.
There are two game modes, 1 vs 1 and 2 vs 2.
And the rules of the game are also included.
